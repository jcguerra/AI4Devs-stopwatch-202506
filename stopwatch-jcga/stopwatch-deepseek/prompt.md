## Initial Prompt

Create a web page with a Stopwatch and a Countdown, which has the following acceptance criteria:

## Technical Criteria:
- First that it complies with SOLID principles.
- Separate HTML, Javascript and CSS code in files such as index.html, script.js and styles.css.
- Implement logs and exceptions as needed.
- Make annotations in the code describing what each block or method of the code does.
- Make sure it is a responsive website.

## Functional Criteria:
- First of all, I need to give the user a selection option: to choose whether they want to use the Stopwatch or the Countdown. For that, we need two 300x300 icons representing each action — a green Stopwatch and a red Countdown — each accompanied by a corresponding title. Regardless of which option the user selects, the screen should either change or navigate to the corresponding view: if they choose Stopwatch, it should go to the Stopwatch screen, and the same for the Countdown. Consider whether it might be better to use a lateral slide to show the Stopwatch or Countdown instead of switching screens.
- The stopwatch must have a time display and two buttons: a green Start button and a red Clear button. The time display should show the time in large numbers, initially set to 00:00:00. Once the user clicks the Start button, the timer begins to run, and the Start button should be hidden and replaced by a new Pause button. When the user clicks Pause, it hides and shows a Continue button in blue, allowing the user to pause or resume the timer as desired. The Clear button resets the timer back to zero. This screen must also include a breadcrumb to return to the initial screen where the Stopwatch and Countdown options are shown.
- The Countdown must have, just like the Stopwatch, a time display. It should include buttons from 0 to 9 so the user can input the desired countdown time, along with a Set button to confirm the entered time, and a Clear button to reset the time if needed. Once the user confirms the time with the Set button, the number buttons, Set, and Clear should be hidden, and the Start and Clear buttons (in green and red respectively) should be shown, just like in the Stopwatch. These buttons will allow the user to start the countdown and have the same behavior for Pause, Continue, and Clear as in the Stopwatch. This screen should also include a breadcrumb to return to the initial screen.
- Add titles to each screen according to the user's selection.
- Include milliseconds in the display, you can add them, but they should be shown in a subtle way — with the milliseconds in smaller-sized numbers.

## Stack Tecnológico:
- HTML 5
- Vanilla JS
- Tailwind CSS

Ask me for any additional information you need before getting started.

## Stopwatch & Countdown Timer Web App

I'll create a responsive web application with a stopwatch and countdown timer that meets all your requirements. Let me break down the solution:

Implementation Plan
Create a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS

Implement a sliding screen transition for navigation

Build a stopwatch with start/pause/continue/clear functionality

Create a countdown timer with number input and timer controls

Ensure SOLID principles in JavaScript design

Include proper error handling and logging

Final Solution
Here are the complete files for the solution:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

## Features and Design

### SOLID Principles Implementation
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
    - Timer class handles base timing functionality
    - Stopwatch class extends Timer for stopwatch-specific behavior
    - CountdownTimer implements countdown-specific logic
    - UIController manages all UI interactions

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
    - Base Timer class is open for extension but closed for modification
    - New timer types can be added without changing existing code

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
    - Stopwatch properly extends Timer without altering base behavior

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
    - Each class has specific interfaces tailored to its needs

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    - High-level UIController depends on abstractions (Timer interfaces)
    - Low-level timer implementations depend on the same abstractions

### Responsive Design
    - Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS
    - Mobile-friendly controls with appropriate spacing
    - Font size adjustments for different screen sizes
    - Touch-friendly buttons and controls

### Functionality

1. Home Screen:
    - Two 300x300 cards for Stopwatch and Countdown
    - Green stopwatch icon and red countdown icon
    - Smooth transition to selected timer

2. Stopwatch:
    - Start/Pause/Continue/Clear functionality
    - Time display with milliseconds in smaller font
    - Breadcrumb navigation back to home screen

3. Countdown:
    - Number input pad (0-9)
    - Set/Clear buttons for time input
    - Start/Pause/Continue/Clear functionality
    - Audio alert when countdown completes
    - Breadcrumb navigation back to home screen

### Error Handling
    - Comprehensive try/catch blocks
    - Meaningful error messages in console
    - User alerts for critical errors
    - Input validation for countdown time

### How to Use

1. Open the home screen and select either Stopwatch or Countdown

2. For Stopwatch:
    - Click Start to begin timing
    - Pause to stop the timer
    - Continue to resume timing
    - Clear to reset to zero

3. For Countdown:
    - Enter time using number pad (HH:MM:SS format)
    - Click Set to confirm the time
    - Start the countdown
    - Pause/Continue as needed
    - Clear to reset the timer

4. Use the back arrow to return to the home screen

This implementation meets all your requirements with a clean, responsive design and well-structured code following SOLID principles.

###### JCGA

I need to make an adjustment in the countdown, as the time is being added through the number buttons from 0 to 9, this time should be displayed in the viewer so that the user can see the time that is being added and can verify the time and confirm it.

## Enhanced Stopwatch and Countdown Timer Application

I'll implement your requested adjustment for the countdown timer to display the input time as the user presses buttons. Here's the complete solution:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

### Key Improvements for Countdown Input
I've implemented the requested adjustment for the countdown timer with these enhancements:

1. Visual Time Input Display
    - Added a dedicated time input section showing hours, minutes, and seconds
    - Each time component is displayed in its own clearly labeled box
    - The current active field is highlighted with a blue border

2. Interactive Input Indicators
    - Each time field has a floating indicator (HH, MM, SS) that pulses when active
    - Users can click directly on any time field to select it for input

3. Intuitive Navigation
    - Automatically moves to the next field after two digits are entered
    - Added a backspace button to correct mistakes
    - Clear button resets all input fields

4. Real-time Feedback
    - The main display updates as the user enters numbers
    - Users can see exactly what time they're setting before confirming

5. Responsive Design
    - Maintained responsive layout for all screen sizes
    - Adjusted font sizes and spacing for mobile devices

### How the Countdown Input Works

1. When the user selects the Countdown option, they see:
    - Large timer display (00:00:00.000)
    - Time input fields (hours, minutes, seconds)
    - Number pad (0-9)
    - Set, Clear, and Backspace buttons

2. To set the time:
    - Click on the field you want to set (seconds, minutes, or hours)
    - Enter digits using the number pad
    - The field automatically limits values to valid ranges
    - The timer display updates in real-time

3. When satisfied with the time:
    - Press the green "Set" button
    - The input controls are replaced by timer controls

This implementation gives users complete visibility and control over the countdown time they're setting, meeting all your requirements while maintaining the SOLID principles and responsive design.

###### JCGA

the time display in the countdown is duplicated, delete the one below, but we have to adjust the way the time is set, as the user enters the time in the number buttons, this should be entered in the following way, for example:

i am going to add a time of 1:hour, 23 minutes, 45 seconds, that when i finish adding it should look like this in the display: 01:23:45. and if i start entering the time, this is what should happen: 
- if i add the number 1 it should look like this in the display: 00:00:01
- if I continue and add number 2, it should look like this 00:00:12
- if I add number 3, it should look like this 00:01:23
- if I add 4, it should look like this 00:12:34
- and finally if I add 5, it should look like this 01:23:45 and the time should be ready to confirm it.

don't forget to keep the styles and css separate from html
